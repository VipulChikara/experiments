# Welcome to Infinity Grid Experiment 
In this experiment I have tried to dynamically create some grids of random dimensions with JavaScript & Bootstrap 4.
I have given it a subtle parallax effect as well. View [DEMO](https://iamshouvikmitra.github.io/experiments/web/infinitygrid/)

## Contribution
If you really like this experiment, try adding more custom types in ```script.js``` file and send me a PR to get them added.
